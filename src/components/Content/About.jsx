      <p>
       I’m a Full Stack Engineer specializing in React and React Native, with a strong focus on building pixel-perfect, intuitive user interfaces backed by clean, scalable, and high-performance architectures. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, where thoughtful user experience meets robust implementation.

      <p className="m-t-10">
        Currently, I work as a Full Stack Engineer, building scalable web and mobile applications using React, React Native, and the MERN stack, with experience across AngularJS as well. I focus on creating pixel-perfect, intuitive user interfaces backed by clean, high-performance architectures. My role spans frontend, backend, and cloud infrastructure, leveraging AWS services to design and deploy reliable, cloud-native solutions. I’m deeply invested in code quality, performance optimization, and maintainability, delivering products end-to-end from concept through production while balancing strong engineering practices with thoughtful user experience.

      <p className="m-t-10">
        Previously, I worked across multiple engineering roles where I helped build and scale complex web applications in enterprise, AdTech, and high-security domains. I led frontend modernization efforts, including migrating large Angular applications to React functional components, significantly reducing technical complexity and improving maintainability. I developed interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and network topology tools, while also delivering secure, compliance-driven applications for regulated environments. Alongside hands-on development, I improved code quality through stronger testing practices, established coding standards, implemented CI/CD pipelines, and contributed to team growth through mentoring, Agile delivery, and technical hiring.
